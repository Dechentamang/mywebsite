    <meta name="Drawings are going to be some of the drawings i do have that i am proud of that i did not do in school.
The chill type of ones because i don’t want to go too hardcore on drawing. The details are going to be too much then.
painting/water color is going to be something i do a lot or your going to see a lot of it . but i try to stay away from dark colors because water colors are not something that’s dark so i am trying to fit the theme of it.
My about me page is going to be some things like how i started to get into drawings or paintings … the things i like .. the things i don’t like.. But i don’t want to give too much info about me because my web is based on my art not me so the about me part is not going to be that long .
\contact is going to be about how they can find my or contact me . so it’s just going to be a little thing that has all my contacts in it ,.>
